# systeminfo
[![GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/mohae/systeminfo.svg)](https://godoc.org/github.com/mohae/systeminfo)[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mohae/systeminfo.png)](https://travis-ci.org/mohae/systeminfo)

Information about a system: Sockets, RAM, network interfaces, OS, Kernel.  This only works on Linux, for now.

Only basic information about a system is gathered.  For more detailed informatino about different aspects of a system, use the relevant [JoeFriday](https://github.com/mohae/joefriday) packages.

Convenience functions are provided for Marshaling and Unmarshaling the data using either `JSON` or `ProtoBuf` serialization.

## Supported output
* Go struct
* JSON
* Protocol Buffers
* Flatbuffers

## Notes
If using the flatbuffers implementation, the package name is still `systeminfo` even though the import path is `github.com/mohae/systeminfo/flat`.  If one is also using the `github.com/mohae/systeminfo.System` struct one of the packages will need to be aliased. 

## TODO
Add disk information.  
Add support for other platforms.
